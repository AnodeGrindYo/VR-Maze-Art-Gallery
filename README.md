# Virtual Reality Art Exhibition in a procedurally generated maze

Welcome to my art exhibition, a browser-based VR experience where a maze is procedurally generated, and every wall of the maze is adorned with some of my drawings.

## Demo

Experience the maze live [here](https://codepen.io/Adr_G/full/ZEVzLoK).

## Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**: The maze is randomly generated each time to ensure a fresh experience.
- **Unique Wall Textures**: Every maze wall showcases one of the drawings, transforming the maze into an art exhibition.
- **VR Ready**: Engage in a VR-based navigation experience.
- **Fully responsive and usable on a smartphone**


## How It Works

1. The maze is randomly generated using a depth-first search algorithm.
2. Walls of the maze are assigned a random image from a collection of drawings.
3. Users can navigate using arrow keys (or a touch joystick and the gyroscope on a smartphone).
4. A solution, marked with arrows, can guide the user from the start to the finish of the maze.
